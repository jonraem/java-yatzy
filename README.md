This was a school project for a course about object-oriented programming. It is a Yatzy game in which you throw the dice and then choose which hand to associate the dice with. The code along with the classes and prompts are all in Finnish so it may be hard to play unless you speak the language. If you do, just follow the prompts to play.

To run the program, have all the necessary files in the same folder and run the <code>Testaus.java</code> file first. The program gets sluggish fast because it prints the scoreboard to the console after every throw. So it is advisable to have only one player for testing.
